   - **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identification and analysis of all stakeholders

2. **Design Specification (design.md)**
   - **Technical Architecture**: Comprehensive system architecture and design
   - **Component Design**: Detailed component specifications and interfaces
   - **Data Models**: Complete data model design and relationships
   - **Integration Patterns**: API and service integration specifications [8]

    the: SystemName;
    shall: SystemResponse;
    where: OptionalPostcondition;
  };
  validation: {
    testability: TestabilityAnalysis;
    completeness: CompletenessCheck;
    consistency: ConsistencyValidation;
    traceability: TraceabilityMatrix;
  };
  compliance: {
    stakeholderApproval: StakeholderValidation;
    regulatoryAlignment: RegulatoryCompliance;
    businessAlignment: BusinessValidation;
    technicalFeasibility: TechnicalValidation;
  };
}
```

**EARS Benefits for Enterprise Development:**
